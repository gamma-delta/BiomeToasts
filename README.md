# Biome Toasts

A simple Forge mod that provides little popups (like advancements) upon switching biomes.

By default, the mod uses icons for each biome taken from the Minecraft Wiki.
An alternate resource pack that uses items and blocks for each biome is bundled with the mod
(activate it from the resource pack section of the menu as you would any other resource pack).
